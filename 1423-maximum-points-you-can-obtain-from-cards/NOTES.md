**Intuition**
The idea here is pretty tricky to guess...
​
* What we do is we initialize a window of size k...
* Now, since we can select either from the start or from the end, we only have access to either the first k items or last k items, and hence we are trying to limit our access using this window...
* So, we include all the elements from start in our window, till its full...
* The sum of elements at each instance in our window will be kept track of using another variable that will store our result.
* Now, we remove the last element from our window, and add the last unvisited element of our cardPoints array... Similarly we keep on removing 1 element from our window and start adding the last unvisited element of our cardPoints array...
* We keep doing this until we reach the start of our array, in this way we have covered all our possible picks...
