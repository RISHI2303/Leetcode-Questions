The demand of the question is to get **INCREASING** and **DECREASING** sequences alternating.
Now re-arranging of array is not possible, Hence **NUMBER OF TIMES ARRAY CHANGES** from increasing to decreasing & vice versa **REMAINS CONSTANT**.

The question can now reduced to find number of times array changes pattern.
Further , it can be deduced that we have to **COUNT THE NUMBER OF PEAKS AND VALLEY POINTS**.

EXAMPLE 1 => `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]`
